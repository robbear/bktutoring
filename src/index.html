          We offer educational therapy and structured tutoring services that are 
          customized to your student's individual learning needs and educational goals. We foster a 
          love for learning that serves as a foundation for developing confidence, self-esteem, inner motivation, 
          and future achievement. Serving the San Francisco Peninsula and South Bay, we provide intervention 
          and strategies for learning disabilities in reading, writing, and mathematics.

        We offer a caring, supportive, and individualized learning experience for each student. 
        We utilize research-based and structured teaching practices for targeted intervention 
        and remediation. We help students understand the unique way they learn and guide them with 
        customized, developmentally appropriate tools to foster their learning independence.

      <p>
        We also help parents recognize the nature and context of their student's learning 
        patterns and strengths so that the parent can further assist their student through 
        new insights and understandings.

        Your child grows more self-confident as they master their own methods of learning. We
        understand the long journey of your child's learning over the course of their life, through
        both their school years and their professional careers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We help your child understand their own unique way of seeing the world, the ways they
        naturally learn, and help them to build confidence in these innate skills. We help them
        identify context, understand their own patterns of learning, and help them grow confidence
        in their patterns of learning and self-understanding. This is confidence they will
        rely on through the course of their lives.

          Rob works with Linda in providing mathematics tutoring and learning strategies for
          older students. He consults with Linda in helping to identify root learning issues 
          and remediation strategies where a child may struggle with higher level mathematics 
          concepts and strategies.
