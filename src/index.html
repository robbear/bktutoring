              A love for learning is a foundation for developing self-confidence, inner motivation, and future success. 
              Reading success is key to building this foundation – as skills improve, so does a child’s confidence.

              I have been an early childhood educator for more than 25 years, with an 
              MA in Early Childhood Education/Special Education. My experience working with 
              young children ranges from teacher to education specialist to program administrator
              training and supporting other teachers in a variety of learning situations.

              Whether in the high school classroom, or building software with teams at places like Microsoft, my
              favorite times in my career were helping others one-on-one, striving to see
              their perspective as a way of bringing new understandings. Teaching is a way to broaden my own learning,
              and I enjoy the deeper insights about mathematics that come to me through
              the eyes of those I help.
            </p>
            <p>
              I earned a Master's degree in Education at Stanford after studying Astronomy
              and Physics at UC Berkeley. I taught first and second year Algebra along with
              Physics in the 1980s before joining the software industry. I am fascinated with
              the history and practice of mathematics, and I want to help students by giving
              them a broader perspective of their mathematics learning through their own interests and 
              self-awareness.
